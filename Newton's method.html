          In numerical analysis, Newton's method, also known as the
          Newton–Raphson method, named after Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson, is
          a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better
          approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. The
          most basic version starts with a single-variable function f defined
          for a real variable x, the function's derivative f ′, and an initial
          guess x0 for a root of f. If the function satisfies sufficient
          assumptions and the initial guess is close, then

          is a better approximation of the root than x0. Geometrically, (x1, 0)
          is the intersection of the x-axis and the tangent of the graph of f at
          (x0, f (x0)): that is, the improved guess is the unique root of the
          linear approximation at the initial point. The process is repeated as

          until a sufficiently precise value is reached. This algorithm is first
          in the class of Householder's methods, succeeded by Halley's method.
          The method can also be extended to complex functions and to systems of
          equations.

          The function f is shown in blue and the tangent line is in red. We see
          that xn + 1 is a better approximation than xn for the root x of the
          function f.

          The idea is to start with an initial guess which is reasonably close
          to the true root, then to approximate the function by its tangent line
          using calculus, and finally to compute the x-intercept of this tangent
          line by elementary algebra. This x-intercept will typically be a
          better approximation to the original function's root than the first
          guess, and the method can be iterated. More formally, suppose f : (a,
          b) → ℝ is a differentiable function defined on the interval (a, b)
          with values in the real numbers ℝ, and we have some current
          approximation xn. Then we can derive the formula for a better
          approximation, xn + 1 by referring to the diagram on the right. The
          equation of the tangent line to the curve y = f (x) at x = xn is

          where f′ denotes the derivative. The x-intercept of this line (the
          value of x which makes y = 0) is taken as the next approximation,xn +
          1, to the root, so that the equation of the tangent line is satisfied
          when {\displaystyle (x,y)=(x_{n+1},0)} {\displaystyle
          (x,y)=(x_{n+1},0)}:

          We start the process with some arbitrary initial value x0. (The closer
          to the zero, the better. But, in the absence of any intuition about
          where the zero might lie, a "guess and check" method might narrow the
          possibilities to a reasonably small interval by appealing to the
          intermediate value theorem.) The method will usually converge,
          provided this initial guess is close enough to the unknown zero, and
          that f ′(x0) ≠ 0. Furthermore, for a zero of multiplicity 1, the
          convergence is at least quadratic (see rate of convergence) in a
          neighbourhood of the zero, which intuitively means that the number of
          correct digits roughly doubles in every step. More details can be
          found in the analysis section below. Householder's methods are similar
          but have higher order for even faster convergence. However, the extra
          computations required for each step can slow down the overall
          performance relative to Newton's method, particularly if f or its
          derivatives are computationally expensive to evaluate.
